	<h1>Correlated Data and Reputation Aware Data Cleaning</h1>
	ACCEPTED TO BIGCYBER WORKSHOP AS A PART OF IEEE 2018 BIG DATA CONFERENCE IN SEATTLE ON DECEMBER 10-13 as <i>Reputation-Aware Data Fusion and Malicious Participant Detection in Mobile Crowdsensing</i> by: Yujian ‘Charles’ Tang*+, Samia Tasnim*, Niki Pissinou, S. S. Iyengar, Abdur Shahid
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
		As part of the Research Experience for Undergraduates program run by the National Science Foundation, I did research at Florida International University under Dr. Niki Pissinou with a graduate student mentor, Samia Tasnim. My research topic was on data cleaning for data collected through mobile crowdsensing. I combined two different data cleaning methods used on mobile crowdsensing data, reputation, and correlated data. I extended the ideas from a 2014 paper on a reputation framework and a 2017 paper on correlated data.

	<h3>Abstract</h3>
	<p>
		Mobile Crowdsensing using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are an emerging sensing mode. WSNs provide an efficient way to collect large scale data remotely in a decentralized fashion. As with any data collection mode there must be some level of data cleaning. Most traditional methods are not suited for WSNs because they are open environments. Many existing works on data cleaning for WSNs explore reputation frameworks as models for weeding out bad data or malicious users. Some existing works also look at using correlated data to increase the accuracy of data from WSNs. One element that this paper looks at that few existing works on WSNs look at is sparsity of data. Not all discrete regions or blocks of time will have data to report; sparsity is something that must be considered for many real life scenarios. This paper shows that using a reputation framework with correlated data yields more accurate data prediction than either alone. Accounting for sparsity, we also show that our method is more accurate in data per time period than a temporal linear regression. To our knowledge, this is the first paper with these goals.

	<h1>Generating Cortical Surfaces of Macaque Brains using the CIVET pipeline</h1>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
		There exist multiple tools to generate cortical surfaces of human brains, but there aren't any for macaque brains. My first research project was trying to adapt the CIVET pipeline, a brain image processing tool created for human brains, to produce cortical surfaces of macaque brains. The challenge here is that macaque brains have a different structure from human brains including deeper eye sockets, and a flatter shape. The novelty here is the production of a better cortical surface for macaque brains.
	</p>
	<h3>Abstract</h3>
	<p>
		We want to be able to get better surfaces of macaque brains in order to study them. It's beneficial to study macaque brains because it's easier to control for environmental factors. The challenge is that current brain image to surface pipelines/methods are designed to match the human brain. Macaque brains differe from human brains in shape and size, and have some significant structural differences, especially in the front inferior region due to deep set and bigger eyes. We want to adapt the CIVET pipeline to create surfaces of macaque brains. One of our reasons for this is because the CIVET pipeline is highly editable. We found that while we were able to get much better white matter surfaces, generation of grey matter surfaces is not as good due to deeper folds in macaque brains compared to human brains. Our current direction of grey matter surface generation is editing and using the white matter expansion script, specifically changing the laplacian weights to allow for more expansion.
	</p>
	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p>
		Beginning results were largely problematic as expected. Over the course of a year I found many different errors thrown by the CIVET pipeline due to either the shape of the brain, the placement of structures, the labeling of structures, and many other similar errors. We decided to focus on creating a good white matter surface first due to the deeper folds making generating a grey matter surface challenging without a good white matter surface. After creation of the white matter surface we used it to create the grey matter surface through a double expansion. This project resulted in the production of multiple pipelining scripts, edited expansion scripts, a <a href = "./civet-presentation.pdf">presentation</a>, and a technical paper.
