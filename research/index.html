	<h1>Correlated Data and Reputation Aware Data Cleaning</h1>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
		As part of the Research Experience for Undergraduates program run by the National Science Foundation, I did research at Florida International University under Dr. Niki Pissinou with a graduate student mentor, Samia Tasnim. My research topic was on data cleaning for data collected through mobile crowdsensing. I combined two different data cleaning methods used on mobile crowdsensing data, reputation, and correlated data. I extended the ideas from a 2014 paper

	<h3>Abstract</h3>
	<p>
		Mobile Crowdsensing using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are an emerging sensing mode. WSNs provide an efficient way to collect large scale data remotely in a decentralized fashion. As with any data collection mode there must be some level of data cleaning. Most traditional methods are not suited for WSNs because they are open environments. Many existing works on data cleaning for WSNs explore reputation frameworks as models for weeding out bad data or malicious users. Some existing works also look at using correlated data to increase the accuracy of data from WSNs. One element that this paper looks at that few existing works on WSNs look at is sparsity of data. Not all discrete regions or blocks of time will have data to report; sparsity is something that must be considered for many real life scenarios. This paper shows that using a reputation framework with correlated data yields more accurate data prediction than either alone. Accounting for sparsity, we also show that our method is more accurate in data per time period than a temporal linear regression. To our knowledge, this is the first paper with these goals.
