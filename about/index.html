	<h1>Academic Interests/History</h1>
	<p>
		My academic career has always been very mathematically focused. I started learning extracurricular math in middle school. In 6th grade I was introduced to MathCounts and began my foray into what most people call "contest math". I participated in the AMCs, AIME, and ARML in high school. In my senior year I was the first place senior at the NC State Math Contest. I currently study computer science at the University of North Carolina. During the time I've been a student at UNC I've expanded my topics of interest to a more applied view of mathematics. Through internships at tech companies of varying degrees, research positions on various topics, and two different experiences as a teaching assistant I've found that my interests lean towards the analysis of large data sets through the use of different mathematical techniques. Of these techniques, I'm most interested in the application of neural networks.

	<h1>Extracurricular Activities</h1>
	<p>
		I did club swimming as a child from 11-15 and then again from 16-18. I was an all-state swimmer in North Carolina and a multiple time all-conference swimmer. I've been involved in many different clubs or organizations at UNC in an effort to expand my social and personal horizons. I've participated in ACM, Tespa, intramural sports, community government, and Greek life. My main activities now are community government and my fraternity. On community government, I served as Lieutenant Governor for 2017-2018, and I have been elected Governor this year. For my fraternity, Pi Alpha Phi, I served as rush, social, and brotherhood chair in the spring semester of 2018, and I am serving as the academic chair for fall 2018.
