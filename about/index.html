	<h1>Academic Interests/History</h1>
	<p>
		I'm currently a senior at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill majoring in Computer Science, minoring in Statistics and Neuroscience. My academic career has always been very mathematically oriented. I participated in MathCounts, the AMCs, AIME, USAJMO, and ARML. I was the first place senior at the NC State Math Contest in 2015. I interned at IBM as part of my high shcool program. I interned at nCino, a software company built on Salesforce, in the summer of 2016. In the summer of 2017, I started my research at the Neuro Image Research and Analysis Lab working on getting better surfaces of macaque brains. That research ended in a technical paper and a presentation at UNC's Computer Science Research Symposium for Undergraduates. Last summer, I did research as part of a research experience for undergraduates program at Florida International University.

	<h1>Extracurricular Activities</h1>
	<p>
		I did club swimming as a child from 11-15 and then again from 16-18. I was an all-state swimmer in North Carolina and a multiple time all-conference swimmer. I've been involved in many different clubs or organizations at UNC in an effort to expand my social and personal horizons. I've participated in ACM, Tespa, intramural sports, community government, and Greek life. My main activities now are community government and my fraternity. On community government, I served as Lieutenant Governor for 2017-2018, and I have been elected Governor this year. For my fraternity, Pi Alpha Phi, I served as rush, social, and brotherhood chair in the spring semester of 2018, and I am serving as the academic chair for fall 2018.
